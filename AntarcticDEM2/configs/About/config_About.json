		"aboutContent": "<p style='text-align:justify;'>This web application enables the investigation and exploration of the Arctic DEMs. These are created by the Polar Geospatial Center and cover the majority of the Arctic above 60deg North. The DEM mosaic is now at a 2m posting.  This is over 5 times the resolution of the original release. Total coverage of the DEM is 20 million km<sup>2</sup> or just over 10% of planet earth. The release includes 260, 800, 2m positing time-stamped DEM strips that can be used to measure topographic change.The total area coverage of the time-stamped strips is 160 million km<sup>2</sup> meaning the Arctic is covered an average of 8 times. The mosaic is 18TB and the time-dependent DEM strips are 200TB in size. These services are temporal and this app provides tools to review how Arctic has changed over time. Additionally large collections of temporal Multispectral Landsat 8 data are also accessible.<br /><br />For more information on these dataset <a href='https://goto.arcgisonline.com/group/ArcticMaps' target='_blank'>click here</a>.</p>"	}
